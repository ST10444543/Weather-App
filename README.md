The weather app's main goal is to give users a handy way to enter, organize, and evaluate temperature data 
over the course of a week. This application is designed to satisfy the needs of a company that wants to calculate 
the average weekly temperature as well as specific daily temperature data. The software makes sure that users 
can easily enter daily temperatures, examine the average temperature for the week, and access comprehensive 
information for each day by providing a straightforward and user-friendly interface. Organizations that depend on 
precise meteorological data for planning and decision-making would especially benefit from this.

ENHANCING YOUR PRESENTATION
To make its functions easier to use, the program is created with three primary screens: a splash screen, a main 
screen, and a comprehensive view screen. The splash screen acts as an introduction, showing the name of the 
application, the name of the developer, the student number, and an option to go to the main screen or close the 
application. This first screen gives users a clear point of entry and aids with branding. 
The splash screen's professional appearance is enhanced with the addition of a logo, which also improves user 
experience overall

Users can enter daily temperature data, which is maintained by arrays, on the main page. In order to handle this 
data efficiently and calculate the weekly average temperature, the program uses loops. Text boxes for data entry, 
buttons to add temperatures to the array, a temperature calculator, the ability to clear the data, and a link to the 
detailed view page are all included on the main screen. Users can efficiently manage their temperature data with 
this screen, which serves as the center of the app's functionality. To further ensure the integrity of the data, it 
provides the flexibility to remove inaccurate data inputs and re-enter proper information.

hear, without being obnoxious or yelling. Speaking 
at a constant speed is also crucial because

speaking too hastily can make them miss critical 
points. Another important skill is articulation; giving 
your words a clear pronunciation will assist avoid 
misunderstandings. Furthermore, you may avoid 
monotony, which can make listeners tune out, by 
altering your pitch and tone to keep the audience 
interested and highlight important issues.
